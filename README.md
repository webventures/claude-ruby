`claude-ruby` gem is an unofficial ruby SDK for interacting with the Anthropic API, for generating and streaming messages through Claude

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'claude-ruby'
```

And then execute:

```ruby
$ bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```ruby
$ gem install claude-ruby
```

## Usage

To use this gem you'll need an API key from Anthropic, which can be obtained from the Anthropic console  
by following the Get API Access link on the [Anthropic API page](https://www.anthropic.com/api).

Set your API key as an environment variable then you can create a new `Claude::Client` instance:

```ruby
require 'claude/client'

api_key = ENV['YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY']
claude_client = Claude::Client.new(api_key)
```

## Messages

The anthropic messages endpoint allows you to: 
```
Send a structured list of input messages with text and/or image content, 
and the model will generate the next message in the conversation.
The Messages API can be used for for either single queries or stateless multi-turn conversations.
```

Using the claude-ruby gem you can call the Anthropic messages API by passing in an array of messages
where each element is a hash containing `role` and `content` properties.

The `messages` method allows converse with the Claude model in chat form. 
It requires an array of messages where each message is a hash with two properties: `role` and `content`.

`role` can be: 
- `'user'`: This represents the user's input. 
- `'assistant'`: This optional role represents the model's output.

Simple example with a single user message:

```ruby
messages = [
  {
    role: "user",
    content: "Who was the first team to win the rugby world cup?"
  }
]

response = claude_client.messages(messages)
```

The response contains a bunch of metadata and the model's message response.
To extract the message text you can you code like this:

```ruby
response['content'][0]['text']
```

You can continue the conversation by calling the `messages` method again with an expanded messages array:

```ruby

messages << {role: "assistant", content: "New Zealand won the first Rugby World Cup in 1987"}
messages << {role: "user", content: "Who came third and fourth in that competition?"}

response = claude_client.messages(messages)
puts response['content'][0]['text'] # This will give you the updated message
```

Example with a more sophisticated message structure:

```ruby
system = "Only reply in Spanish."

messages = [
  {
    role: "user",
    content: "Hi there."
  },
  {
    role: "assistant",
    content: "Hola, como estÃ¡s?"
  },
  {
    role: "user",
    content: "How long does it take to fly from Auckland to Buenos Aires?"
  },
]

response = claude_client.messages(messages, {system: system})
```
